Another 'discovering the structure of JSON' Haskell exercise today.

You have the follow JSON file:
--}

exDir, newsJSON :: FilePath
exDir = "exercises/HAD/Y2018/M08/D03/"
newsJSON = "news.json"

-- 1. read in the JSON (unprettified) and write it out as pretty JSON

prettify :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()
prettify unprettyIn prettyOut =
    (encodePretty . decode <$> readFile unPrettyIn) >>= writeFile prettyOut

-- this function may be helpful for solving prettify ...

listVals :: ByteString -> [Value]
listVals = fromJust . decode

-- 2. what structures can you see from this enprettified set?

-- ... or ... that's a tough question, let's take this approach, instead:

data Article = Art {
    author               :: String
    , image              :: FilePath
    , url                :: FilePath
    , published, updated :: Date
    , article            :: String
    , idx                :: Integer
    , summary, title     :: String }
   deriving (Eq, Show)

{--
The mapping from the Haskell values to the JSON is as follows:

author       ==> author_meta.display_name
image        ==> image.url
url          ==> link
article      ==> content.rendered
published    ==> date
updated      ==> modified
idx          ==> id
summary      ==> lede
title        ==> title

map the JSON to the above structure.
--}

readArticles :: FilePath -> IO [Article]
readArticles json = undefined

-- will listVals help here?

-- a. how many articles are there?

-- b. what was the max id of the article set?
